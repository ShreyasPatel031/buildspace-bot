Imagine you have a special box called a Capsule. This box is very secure because it uses special technology called blockchain to protect whatever you put inside. You can think of the Capsule like a digital vault that keeps your important things safe.

Inside the Capsule, you can store your 3D objects. These objects are like virtual things that you create or collect. The Capsule makes sure that only you can control and access these objects, so you don't have to worry about them being taken or lost.

The Capsule also helps you share your 3D objects with other people. For example, if you're working on a project with a team, you can easily share your work with them using the Capsule. It keeps everything secure and makes collaboration easy.

And here's something cool: the Capsule lets you sell your 3D objects or buy objects from other people in a special place called the Origami Marketplace. It's like a store where you can trade or sell your virtual creations. So if you have something special that other people want, you can make money from it or find unique things to add to your collection.

Overall, Origami is a platform that brings together people who love working with 3D objects. It gives you a safe place to store your creations, share them with others, and even make money from them.",my name is Louis Xavier and today I want to use you to origami the heart of origami is the capsule a unique storage system where users can securely store their 3D objects these capsules offer multiple benefits for collectors creators and enthusiasts elect first the capsule provides top-notch security for your digital asset thanks to blockchain technology each capsule has a unique immutable record ensuring their owners absolute control over their digital assets capsules harness the power of decentralization members can upload their photos to decentralized storage like grimfield or traditional cloud storage like Google Drive second capsules make it easy for sharing and collaborating capsules provide a secure and convenient way to share your work thirdly capsules open a new window to monetization in the origami Market a vibrant ecosystem where creators can sell their 3D objects and collectors can invest in unique digital assets seamlessly list your capsule on the marketplace opening a gateway to turn your creativity into Commerce the origami Marketplace is more than a platform by Bridging the Gap between creation and monetization station origami allows you to prosper in the world of 3dr finally origami leverages a powerful GPU Network to boost the creation process of 3D object Partners can rent out their gpus when not new we invite you to join us on this exciting Journey thank you

week me and my teammate Vynkatesh  were working together on a decentralized music 
platform our primary goal is to empower artists   of all kinds eliminating any third party and 
providing them with multiple Avenues to connect   with their fans on a deeper level we have two sets 
of products one is decibbl for artists protocol it   is exclusively designed for artists to distribute 
their artwork manage payment settings royalty   splits for collaborations and even generate 
unique nfts in partnership with us by creating   decible artist account artists can gain ability to 
distribute their work on multiple platforms that   will be built on top of our protocol our another 
product is decibbl music which is built on top   of decibbl for artists protocol it's not just 
a platform to discover new artists and stream   music it's also a place where fans can actively 
engage with their favorite artists and support   them in various ways while receiving incentives 
in return our goal was to onboard 350 users but   as you can see we didn't reach that our journey 
in building this platform has been extensive but   we made significant progress over the past six 
weeks initially we thought it would be sufficient   for artists to sign up on a landing page however 
we quickly realized the importance of fostering   a strong Community as a result we created a 
Discord server bringing artists and listeners   together to facilitate open discussions 
and gather feedback these collaborative   approach has been instrumental in our growth 
starting from scratch we have finally taken off   and onboarded two artists one of the artists 
has already uploaded his tracks on the platform   we had a great time this season 
hope to make it soon thank you"

As part of buildspace s3.,hi so what I created was basically a living protocol which is a newsletter exploring living in the age of AI and how humans can remain empowered while being aware of pitfalls moving forward so it was actually rather difficult of explaining this in the very beginning though it take a lot easier after I launched this about page where I managed to sort of explain in a lot more detail that basically what this aims to do so the cover is of how humans and AI can coexist while humans maintain their sense of well-being and motivation quickly and so on and so forth as for the development process what happened was that I took a feedback from Discord and also Twitter on how basically explain like sort of like the rationale behind this newsletter because there are so many new centers out there already so um and also um in terms of analytics what I did was to try to use the substagnative analytics at first though I realized that while it can tell you like what your sources are but it doesn't tell you like um exact unique views so that is why I had to sort of install Google analytics halfway through and even so now I realize that it may not have been configured to capture email statistics so that means like in your open rates and so on and so forth so that is something I do have to sort of like Rectify like currently yep so living protocol is definitely still in its early stages so you can definitely be part of the discussion shape it or just leave a comment check it out thank you
