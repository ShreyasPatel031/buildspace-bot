buildspace n&w s4",hey everyone this is Hal ping I built an app called punches it's a progress tracker with generative art visualization that could help people make consistent progress toward their goal here's how it works first you need to set your work in progress a working progress is a thing that you're working on my working progress for example would be build an app that help people make consistent progress toward the goal now your working progress is ready the next step is to work on it and every time you work on your work in progress you come back and you make a punch a punch is like a check-in on your work in progress it could be anything that you've done to your work in progress my punch for example would be record a demo video for punches after you make a punch you'll see it being visualized with generative art you just continue to work on yourself make another punch and you'll see a new version of the visualization being generated and you just repeat the process basically in the end the visualization will look something like this I spent about three weeks building the front end writing smart contract testing with different visualization I got some tractions on Twitter people are asking if they could use different visualizations just as I know that this is an app built on the blockchain called tezos mainly because the data ownership and other potential benefits but I also learned that the user experience of a wap3 app is just not smooth enough and it becomes a major barrier for people who wants to use sponges the next step is to really improve the user experience by converting part of the process to the web 2 approach and put more effort into finding the people who actually need or want to use punches that's pretty much it peace

Welcome to a journey that's changing the narrative around autism! 🌟

What's AutismNameArt.com?
I'm Paul, and I've created an autism-themed e-commerce store where 100% of the profits go to charity. Why? Because my son, like 1 in 54 children in the U.S., navigates life through the lens of autism. And we're here to tell you—it's not a disability; it's a different ability.

Why These Designs?
Our collections are more than just eye-catching designs! They're stories that resonate with the autistic community. Dandelions symbolize untapped potential, and Minecraft—a favourite of my son—embodies limitless creativity.

Where Are We Now?
Six weeks ago, this was just a concept. Today, we've raised over $900 towards our $2,000 charity goal and are in the final stages of integrating with Printful for seamless order fulfilment.

You can get in touch at X.",which is a way to discover hidden Indian gems so when you go online on Indian social media these days you're going to find videos like this of monuments which are in a state of neglect and discipline and this is actually a really big problem in India where you have a lot of monuments being lost because there's simply too many to keep a track of so the idea with envira is to build out the sort of an online category sorry online catalog of all a lot of places in our country so you can actually understand the historical significance Behind these places and people start caring about them so let's say I click ruins and I click surprise me so it's going to take me to a new place and we have these cards ingrained into them where it takes you to the Wikipedia listing or the Google Maps listening on these places there's also a discover page where we have really cool history stories like this one about the fall of old 4K lamps four billions of Fort which were established when Kolkata is itself establishes a city or a trading post by the britishers so looking back at a progress this is where we were ready to we had a simple svj map with no data on it and we had no Pages we had a map of API export with no data on it so we have actually come a long way looking into the future we want to add thousands of new places we want to introduce guided tools on our explore page enable Community contributions so people can actually add it at themselves and lastly it is connecting people with walks happening in real life so right now historians don't have a way of you know putting their listings out of like they're having a walk in Agra maybe they will put it on their Instagram page but I know I can act as a common platform where people can actually come and see those things so if you're interested in following along bookmark and webmap.com and I'll be willing to hear feedback from you so thank you this was a demo for build space season 4.

Email - vc289@cornell.edu",hi I'm Vikram I'm building a tool to help companies optimize internal communication and hopefully save more than six hours a week per person my tool runs an algorithm on company communication data to find the most optimal way to convey information between people and reduced time waste overall so you can see the dashboard that I built for that here so on the left we have a graph representation right here of the team and the connections in that team along with the communication they had represented by the number of emails chats and meetings that they have on the right we can see the unoptimized time taken to communicate as well as the optimize time taken to communicate this results in four hundred dollars per week being saved at 10 hours a week or almost twenty one thousand dollars per year this is something that I've only been working on for the last two weeks because I originally actually set out to build a meeting optimization tool but after building out the initial version for that and talking to users I learned that meanings weren't actually the problem meanings we're just a way for people to do what they actually wanted to do which was communicate socialize or engage at work but they were currently just doing doing it unoptimally by using meetings emails chats and all these forms in the wrong way so I needed to build something that helped do those same things but do it optimally so I did a little bit of math a little bit of coding and now we ended up here going forward I'm going to keep building this adding features to make it completely workplace ready and improving the algorithm I want to make sure that this is something that every company uses and can use and allows me to give back hours to people that truly deserve it if you like what I'm building shoot me an email or follow on LinkedIn or Twitter

Hello everyone! I'm Amaan Sayyad, a blockchain developer and the Co-founder of Feed Our World. In this video, I'll introduce you to Feed Our World, a one-stop solution that aims to create a sustainable environment. Feed Our World combines two different aspects: providing fresh farm products to consumers and facilitating food donations to those in need. I'll walk you through the application, showcasing its features and how it works. 

🌍 Join us in the fight against hunger! Introducing ""Feed Our World,"" a groundbreaking project that leverages celo blockchain technology and artificial intelligence (AI) to make hunger relief more efficient, transparent, and impactful.

🤝 In a world where millions go to bed hungry every night, ""Feed Our World"" empowers individuals, organizations, and communities to come together and make a real difference. Our platform connects donors, travellers, NGOs, and individuals in need through a decentralized network.

📱 With our user-friendly mobile app, anyone can instantly respond to food requests. Capture a photo, drop a location pin, and your act of kindness is recorded securely on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and accountability.

🌐 Blockchain technology guarantees that every food donation is traceable from the moment it's contributed to when it reaches those in need. No more uncertainty about where your donations are going!

🍲 We're reducing food waste by connecting surplus food with those who need it most. Plus, our platform encourages community involvement, allowing travellers and locals to participate in hunger relief efforts.

A mobile-based website leveraging the CELO blockchain to revolutionize the food industry. We connect producers and consumers directly, reducing food waste and eliminating unnecessary transaction fees. With our user-friendly platform, producers can showcase their products while consumers enjoy secure and cost-effective transactions. CELO blockchain ensures scalability and efficiency, transforming traditional supply chains. Say goodbye to credit card fees as Feed Our World enables direct peer-to-peer transactions, empowering both producers and consumers.

of GitN_global. An Instagram page focused around   providing educational content through bite-sized 
posts. The reason I started GitN is because I   realized as a teenager, I spend so much time on 
Instagram, without really gaining any value or   nurturing my brain. So, I decided, if you can't 
beat them, join them and I started GitN. To start   off, from the start of nights&weekends I rebranded 
GitN. Here is what the old logo looked like, and   here is what the new logo looks like. And I stuck 
to the theme and brand fonts throughout my content   creation journey. And I realized that many people 
are interested. If we look at the analytics,   I have quite the reach here with this post. Other 
posts don't do as good, but I am still at the very   starting tipping point, so I decided, I will keep 
going because I really feel like we need to start   focusing more on providing educational content, 
especially in the 21st century. Because it's   quite sad seeing how many people are uneducated 
about different various topics. And I hope that   through my page, I am able to reach people and 
help them add value to their days. Thank you!"

cbflow,model to improve brain age prediction as a potential biomarker for early detection of neurodegenerative diseases,ai/ml,https://www.youtube.com/embed/vygasOgvtrw?iv_load_policy=3&rel=0&modestbranding=1&playsinline=1&autoplay=1,Improving Brain Age Through Multimodal Neuroimaging,"Brain age derived from neuroimaging is an emerging biomarker of neurodegenerative disease risk. However, prior models rely solely on structural MRI despite evidence that functional imaging provides complementary biological information. This study investigated whether adding arterial spin labelling (ASL) MRI to assess cerebral blood flow improves brain age prediction accuracy.

Machine learning models were developed using multimodal MRI data from 478 healthy adults (24-86 years). Combining ASL-derived cerebral blood flow with structural MRI features significantly improved prediction performance (MAE=4.49 years) compared to structural MRI alone (MAE=5.28 years). An extra-trees ensemble model with vascular territory-based cerebral blood flow and gray/white matter volumes as top features showed optimal accuracy.

The model demonstrated good generalizability in an independent test set. These results highlight the value of multimodal neuroimaging for brain health assessment. Incorporating cerebrovascular information from ASL MRI provides more sensitive brain age models to identify accelerated aging patterns associated with heightened risk for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias.

Research by Sindhoora R",the human brain changes in structure and function as VH some of these changes are a part of the healthy brain aging trajectory however some of these features can be early signs of neurodegeneration or dementia I am sindhura and I am working on improving Brain Age prediction using Advanced MRI techniques Brain Age prediction based on neural Imaging data is an emerging biomarker of brain health most prior studies spread it Brain Age using morphological features from structural MRI but I hypothesize that incorporating arterial spin labeling MRI to measure cerebral blood flow would improve accuracy arterial spin labeling or ASL MRI uses magnetically labeled blood water as an endogenous contrast agent to quantify cerebral blood flow or CBF ASL provides key information about brain perfusion and Metabolism that structural MRI cannot my study analyzed multi-modal MRI data from 478 healthy adults aged 20 to 94 years I also use T1 weighted MRI to extract gray matter white matter and ventricular volumes I also use fluid attenated inversion recovery or Flair MRI to quantify white matter hyperintensities which are lesions associated with small vessel disease from the ASL scans I measure total gramata cerebral blood flow and Regional cerebral blood flow in the main vascular territories to account for ah related flow changes I calculated cerebral blood flow as a ratio to deep bite matter perfusion I engineered features from each modality and developed machine learning models combining structural and ESL derived predictors of age using 100 rupees of stratified cross validation I evaluated numerous algorithms including regression support Vector machines and random Forest Ensemble methods the key finding was models incorporating Regional blood flow features predicted age about one year more accurately than structural MRI alone and extratories regressor with T1 and ASL vascular territory cerebral blood flow achieved the lowest mean absolute error of 4.49 years and an r squared of 0.80 this highlights the value of multi-modal neural Imaging for brain age prediction the arterial spin labeling blood flow measures provide complementary information to anatomical MRI cerebral perfusion is an important marker of vascular health and Metabolism adding ASL to standard structural scans better captures age-related changes if conformed in broader clinical cohorts this enhanced brain age model could lead to earlier detection of unhealthy brain aging cognitive decline and dementia Risk by combining multiple MRI modalities we can gain a more holistic view of the Aging brain and move towards personalized assessments of neurodegenerative disease risk to evaluate the robustness of the model I validated it on an independent test set the T1 and ASL extra trees model maintain strong accuracy with the mean absolute error of 5.28 years in this out of sample data it performed comparably to the brain ahr an established open source to School trained on thousands of scans this demonstrates generalize the ability of the model and rules out the possibility of just overfitting the training data however all models did exhibit an age bias whereby they overestimated the age for younger brains and underestimated age for older brains further work is needed to correct this bias improve generalizability across the entire lifespan of an individual nonetheless the vascular territories cerebral blood flow measures emerged as the most predictive neuroimaging features of brain age in particular the middle cerebral artery territory stood out as most important as hyper perfusion here appears linked to aging this provides Clues into the underlying biology and physiology of the Aging brain reduced blood flow May reflect declining vascular reactivity or neurovascular coupling even in health the older adults diminished perfusion is associated with risk of stroke dementia and other age-related brain diseases so detecting lower cerebral blood flow could identify individuals in need of intervention to promote brain health and prevent cognitive decline Beyond dementia detection This research highlights the value of multi-modal neural Imaging to illuminate the multifaceted aging process combining structural and functional MRI provides more biological Insight than either modality alone the methodology could be applied to illuminate healthy versus pathological aging patterns in other conditions like traumatic brain injury multiple sclerosis or schizophrenia the ultimate goal is to develop validated emerging biomarkers that can detect those at risk and guide personalized therapies to maintain neurocognitive health

Yes, I tried AI and it was a mess. I didn't liked the result, and I tried expensive tools that would take me a long time.

So it was easier to just start dubbing it by myself, and I'm going to do this also with the course, and maybe with all the videos in this channel (i hope so, to have more reach).",hey build space Isaac here introducing my 32-hour long course on how to design cool blockchain apps it's in Spanish and English depending on your language like Mr B Channel problem is once a smartone press is deployed it's hard to upgrade so you need a well planned user experience from start devs often struggle to talk with users so current web three apps are pretty biased we'll cover nine topics learning Cur user research and testing privacy and analytics technical constraints security user Journeys user flows UI and business model I was inspired by the last season fre contest so I launch a video the same day despite having some followers and Views previously I've started from scratch on social media producing content recording 8 hours of footage and editing while receiving lots of feedback here's a sneak pick of the first seconds enjoy and subscribe we need more ux designers the journe of a web3 application from scratch looks like this some recurring problems in web3 is that the application don't give feedback to the user there is confusing information displayed on screen lack of accessibility lack of innovation you lose potential users and that leads to potential low celles it can be difficult to prioritize what to add to the application and it is a common mistake made by designers programmers project managers and start Founders alike there are four types of product in web tree this is how we can influence the design of the different blockchain layers the design can sometimes be more important than the code because it really doesn't matter if you have a software that can do several things but that nobody is really going to use

however, I've learned so much over these past six   weeks, and I have a much clearer vision of what I 
want my portfolio to provide and look like. I've   been mostly focusing on HTML5 & CSS3, some backend 
things, and seeing how all of these components   integrate together. I bought two domains one for 
tinkering and one to serve as a professional site.   Although I was hoping to have a completely 
finished on Dynamic site by the end of the six   weeks, that was definitely overly ambitious of me. 
Life got busy, and I got overwhelmed with how much   there was to learn, so I started asking my friends 
about their experiences with web development and   how they decided to design their portfolios. I 
was somewhat surprised to find that most people   use third-party applications. (Convenient and 
efficient!) That's when I realized my real goal   was to learn how to Dev and improve my ability 
to develop and hack web applications. As I saw,   there's so much that goes into web development, so 
for demo day I decided to build this professional   site through Hostinger while I continue to 
work on the code. Initially I wasn't getting   much traction on the websites, so I was surprised 
to see a few people interested in its development   despite my RARE use of social media. I'm going 
to continue building these sites and focus on   improving the design content and code of 
subpages, and finally to start adding my   actual projects including the bug bounty work 
I've been working on. Eventually I'll start to   dive into Frameworks, JavaScript, and back 
end to make the site a little more dynamic.   Meanwhile please feel free to visit both sites periodically to follow their progression. Thanks!"

you can also customize the way they act and you   can also share them with your friends so far we've 
had the most luck posting in places like Reddit   and subreddits like our Singularity but it's also

If you're interested in the tool, don't hesitate to contact Maxime Dubois d'Enghien on LinkedIn, Instagram or Tiktok !",hi everyone I'm Maxim and today I'm going to show you how autoscript works that's the tool I've been developing and its purpose is to help podcasters convert to their podcasts into articles or to be honest right now pretty much any other formats to make sure that they can increase Their audience without having to go through their whole long term content the tool is fairly simple you're going to upload here your file and then simply send it and there you have it so I make a small cut here but normally the metric you can keep in mind is that for one hour of audio it will take two minutes to get the full transcript here I made it with a shorter one so that I can make sure that the the most is short and from there you can also make an article there we go again I made another cut here um this one can be fairly longer it can take up to five minutes um for an audio of about one hour but um yeah that's it um so that's where the project is at the moment I believe the next step will be to make sure that there is an actual user interface with a user space and so on since the testers have to be honest pretty much validated the value of what I bring here and yeah I guess hopefully from me there it will be making the transcript even better more specific if there are some specific nouns and all um and maybe get to other formats and I'm thinking about the shorts thank you very much and have a good day

demand for food is becoming more and more which   causes to increases the price of food products.
We need to find sustainable and innovative   ways to produce enough food to 
feed everyone on the planet.  Duckweed could be the key to solving this problem.
So what's duckweed? they are little leaf like   aquatic plants that floats 
on the surface of the water.  after conducting some study on google, I found 
that it's has rich source of protein, vitamins,   minerals and containing high levels of essential 
amino acids, and medical properties, such as   reducing blood pressure and cholesterol levels.
In India, many people suffer from malnutrition   Because of low purchasing power, poor cannot 
afford to buy desired amount of food for their   family at such high price. But with duckweed's 
ability to grow quickly and easily, it will be   a game changer because it will make it cheaper
Duckweed can be used to create a variety of food   products, such as biscuits, chips noodles and 
more . With the right processing and techniques,   it could be turned into a nutritious and 
tasty daily meals with also at affordable   price that would be fit and accessable to 
all peoples of all ages. Mostly usefull for   African countries where they don't have 
access to food even if they have money  One of the most amazing things about 
duckweed is its ability to double its   biomass in just one or two days. This means 
that it can be harvested quickly and easily,   without the need for expensive equipment. In fact, 
duckweed can be grown in a aquarium,tubs , or even   on rooftops, making it easier for every one
By introducing duckweed-based products in   the market, we could not only help to address 
the issue of malnutrition and hunger but also   create a business opportunity that would 
benefit both consumers and producers."

follow us @TreelineEdu on all platforms",hi there my name is Kyle and together with my co-founder Ricky we are building Tree Line education an ai-powered tool for educators to make lesson plans in just a few clicks let's say we want to make a lesson plan for a grade 6 math class generate a lesson we'll first choose our content type let's start by selecting activity then choose our duration for the activity we'll then input our subject grade level and the curricular competencies that we want to focus on for this lesson now we can input our topic and click plan sapling to begin generating our lesson right away the AI will begin generating your lesson now I like the lesson but personally I like to have example questions through my lesson plans so I'm going to add that to my fine tuning and once I apply the change the lesson will regenerate with the fine tuning and once you're happy with your lesson you can choose to export it as a docx or receive a shareable link to the sapling now like any other tool Tree Lane started out as just an idea but that idea quickly came to life we wouldn't be building Tree Line without the support of teachers in our community who truly believe this is something that can help them in the classroom so what's next well we're going to keep building with feedback from Educators we want to grow the next generation of Student Success to track children out yourself go to app.freeland.education and enter the password build space and if you want to see updates in the future from us follow us on Twitter at Treeland edu thank you build space for all the support and thank you for watching

FlightPath is an assessment and curriculum app to help support students of any age involved in a creative project. It also allows a school to keep track of student progress and to make instructional decisions. The underlying engine for the analysis uses Item Response Theory models for multidimensional analysis and reporting.",hi my name is Andrew and my project is called flightpath the whole idea of flight path is to create software that helps creators create and I'm designing it based on Three core functions the first is to find out where students are by allowing them to select a path through a series of prompts then the software will analyze those responses to optimize the recommendations for next steps for the student and the third function is that they can give feedback anytime the user wants to know how much progress they've made or which lessons they've completed or looking ahead to what's next so I started putting some of the ideas out there on Twitter and kind of seeing what the response was I was starting to get views just a few and then I started changing the format of what I was presenting just to see what would happen and then when I had enough ideas I started creating some surveys to capture real data if you're interested in assessment or education curriculum design entrepreneurship or mentoring I would love to talk to you about the project you can find me on Twitter see the work I've been doing or email me look forward to talking to you thanks

buildspace s4.",hello my name is Rashid I'm on a team with Ingrid and we're the creators of tisk which is a cozy task manager when we set up to create this app our goal was to create something that was friendly and and very inviting that was not over complicated um we also wanted it to be free and open source so it was accessible to everyone and something that was customizable to all kinds of workflows and also something that respected user privacy so this is disk it's very simple when you land on it it doesn't require a login or anything else you can immediately start creating tasks and once you have a task you can edit the description or you can also add tags to help you organize and keep track of all of your tasks so record video logging in is fully optional you can if you want to but that's going to allow us to eventually build all kinds of cool features that users have requested we are working on AI assisted layouts and customization so that users who don't want to code can still add features to it we're also going to let users share tasks with their friends and also have support for reminders and a calendar eventually our vision is to create a full Suite of Open Source and closing software so that we can have more applications that are similar to this thank you

Transcript:
Hi! My name is Linda, and we’re excited to share a new musical ear training game called Perfect Pitch Puzzle. 

In the same way that Wordle challenges your word skills, this game hones your ability to recognize musical notes.

Every day, the game serves up a new sequence of notes. Your job is to guess what those notes are.  

You can play the game using a variety of instruments [video], listen to your guesses before you submit your attempt [video], challenge yourself to increased difficulty mode(s), and track your progress with stats  [video]. 

Here is some behind-the-scenes evolution of how our game has progressed.

[Progression]

What has been the response so far?

Before we even published the URL, a sneak peek of our game unexpectedly got 16K views on TikTok which resulted in a thousand people searching for the game on Google. (Source: https://www.tiktok.com/@lpnotes/video/7269642301826157867) 

And in the last month, game play has hovered around 20-40 visitors per day. [video of google analytics]. Of course, we hope this number increases! 

So.  

What’s next?

Well, you can start playing the game at www.perfectpitchpuzzle.com today! We also have a new Discord community [video] where you can share your daily results and keep up to date on new features we’re building, like a practice mode [video]. 

Perfect Pitch Puzzle is still in beta, but we hope you’ll enjoy following along on our journey!

Divinate is a product research tool that helps teams make sense of customer feedback way faster.","yo what's up my name is Tregg
I'm one of the founders of Divinate  hi there my name is Tyler I'm 
the developer for Divinate  Divinate is a tool that makes research 
easier when you are building a product   everyone tells you to talk to customers and 
get feedback but that's not an easy process   and managing all that becomes a full-time job
so we made something that makes that easier you'll start off by importing a transcript 
from one of your conversations with a user once it's done importing it'll bring you to this 
page where you can see we have a generated summary   and set of tags over on the right hand side
the core functionality is creating highlights   from your transcripts so these are the 
sections of the conversation that are   most valuable to your product decisions
we're going to create a highlight it'll   show up on the right hand side over here and 
then back in the dashboard or in your folders   that highlight is going to show up as well
and we've added over 20 people to our waitlist  and we've talked to 11 people
I mean when we started we   literally didn't have a product
it's day five of nights and weekends I've got   a working uh proof of concept let me show you guys
since then we've iterated based on our demos and   now we're looking at booking sales discovery calls
we've definitely accomplished a ton but we have a   lot more to do what we want next is to take your 
highlights and turn those into automated insights   or allow you to combine them yourself manually 
in documents so you can share that with your team  alright thank you buildspace
we've been Divinate"

datagod,enterprise chatbot with data governance,ai/ml,https://www.youtube.com/embed/69LWiHuov-Y?iv_load_policy=3&rel=0&modestbranding=1&playsinline=1&autoplay=1,Datagod - Enterprise chatbot with data governance,,I'm okay and me and my friend omkar spend the night staying up building data God the chatbot with data governance let's start with the problem Samsung banned an employee for use of charge upd over corporate data we believe that data governance shouldn't abstain people from using productivity and Technology tools and that's why we build data god with two things in mind first is security and governance several data silos exist inside an organization based on the team you are and are based on the amount of your hierarchy or the amount of data you have even access to so that's why we help organizations build a custom index of data which they can further break down into silos that are accessible to one or more groups of users take the example over here we help an organization break down the data such as blogs user guides white papers case studies and serve it to different groups of users such as customers sales marketing folks Solutions architect second even once the data is shared across teams when you want to actually Bridge the silos you would still want to spend some time understanding it and that is why we built an advanced system of infographics and concept mapping into our software let's now just dive into the demo take the example of Patricia who's just a customer and should technically just have access to blogs and user guides let's just quickly sign in as Patricia we're using Cognito for auth let's see if I got the password right in the first attempt should technically work this is your standard charge GPT UI you can select the file you can upload you can ask questions about it here are all your previous chats let's now actually talk about uh what is Amazon Cloud search so incorporate data data got just just does not actually go and get the information it also cites the information say for example sure you might find a very good user guide on cloud search over here so it's not only told us about it it's also told us that hey we fetched it from here and you can go and read more about it and it also fetch other places where Cloud search is mentioned like in the snowball one let's now try to ask a question which Patricia as a customer would not have access to like a white paper so I have one over here you can just ask it to tell us about this particular thing which is like a white paper by AWS so since Patricia is a customer she would not have access to it so data God would just go ahead and show here whatever you ask for I don't have access to it so let's go and change that let's go to data Gods groups we go to Solutions architect let's make Patricia Solutions architect cool so Patricia has been made a Solutions architect let me just quickly copy The Prompt it takes about a while to update it on the index and pass through the llm so I'll just take a two minute pause here yeah Patricia is now officially a Solutions architect so she should have all of the access to the data required by a Solutions architect so we asked the same question tell me more about the VM backup on VMware Cloud using AWS and it would be able to tell like a proper answer right now and it would even be able to cite it so this is what basically datawot does it's even able to cite that hey I got the answer from this particular white paper so this is the first part of it let's talk about since Patrick like Patricia now is a Solutions architect she has access to everything so you can tell me about the transfer wire case study you can ask her about that and it should be able to pull in the case study as well because the solutions architecture have access to a case study so it does and we can definitely go through it we can even get the concept map for that particular case study it's actually a very small image but if we zoom in enough I think we're able to make out the word transfer by here let's see if we can zoom in a bit more I think the image is too small uh you can even ask it about explain to me but about Stripes sales in fintech and you could get an infographic for it it could even be able to cite it it might not always be able to generate an answer but it definitely is able to go ahead and get some level of an answer for you so it can tell you something on the lines of hey Stripes basically yours using these AWS services this was a case study and this was the kind of category spending they had so that was pretty much it uh for data God we solved data governance and we solve intelligence here's our web platform Cognito a retrieval system a generation system a sort of intelligent system and that would be it thank you

@oona_singh_",hi everyone I'm in and I'm working on lightweight which is an iOS workout tracking app that lets you track your workout sessions super simply so let's get it to it so this is what lightweight looks like so you can create a new workout session and what's cool is I can name it let's say lower body day and I have the option to write everything in plain English which is nice because it makes it a little faster a little easier and a little more intuitive in my opinion um so yeah I can write hip thrust 5x5 200 kg which is cool it'll store this as that's reps and the weight if I wanted an exercise that let's say doesn't exist in the exercise library that comes with the app and I wrote let's say kickstand deadlift uh three by ten 48 kg I can just add that exercise and now kickstand deadlift will actually be available in my exercise Library so go ahead and save this session it'll now appear in my history here and we'll be able to see kickstanded left in the exercise library and it wasn't there previously the other option you have is if you don't want to write your own workouts you can actually just use some of the templates that come with the app so you have this option so let's say I want to do this session I can do this one change the weights the sets and the Reps and then save it and it'll store in my workout history you also have the option to actually just create your own templates and then reuse them the other nice thing is you actually have a progress section in the app so you can track the progress so you have the ability to use the one rep max calculator if you want to figure out what your one right box is and certain lists or the progress tracker will actually just display your progress over time on certain exercises so lightweight I hope should be available on the app store soon

In here I explain in less than 90 seconds the success, failure and learnings of this experience.",hey there my name is Andrea and I'm building the underdog tracker the crypto portfolio tracker application for the rest of us why say so because investing is hard investing in crypto is just a nightmare so you need to follow the numbers but the thing is I'm not that Excel guide I don't like spreadsheets so I start to build this application to help all the people like me and with the main focus is always know how much you are exposed like for example if you sell now how much you profit or lose based on your Enterprise so how it went it went really well in at the beginning of real space it was just some proof of concept it was just something that I was playing privately with but then I started to invite people I run just a private battle and I just tested the market with some tweets and I gather 50 people that they gave me plenty of feedback and probably new features didn't talk that I'm thinking about but the experience has been created the feedback is positive so my next step will be making some cool marketing Pages like a proper on page right now it's just a silly one and basically keep launching until I reach my sweet spot thank you

Here's an overview of the app and our design journey! 

0:00 introduction
0:24 3-step guide to storycloud
0:51 design journey",hi Aaron here we're building story Cloud a mobile app to voice record your memories and share them with family and friends growing up our parents used to love sharing childhood stories at dinner but now that we live apart it's hard to find time for these conversations with storycloud loved ones can digitally capture their stories and share them in their own voices let's take a look at how it works first go to the create page you can record from scratch or answer the question of the week your followers can also ask questions and request stories when you click into a prompt you'll see a discussion guide once you're ready hit record when you're done we'll generate story highlights and a transcript add your photos and hit publish and that's it similar to Instagram you'll have a profile page and a feed of news stories comment and react with your favorites designing this app began with extensive user research we interviewed 20 individuals to understand user needs then ideated features on figma then surveyed 60 uses for feature testing from these data points we learned important user insights for example our audience prefers to listen the stories on the go whether it's at the gym or on a morning commute so we created a playlist feature that functions exactly like a Spotify album in the last couple of weeks we've recorded over 50 stories from 25 users we're focused on growing our user base and receiving feedback storycloud's mission is to strengthen family bonding through story if you're interested please reach out or sign up for access
arqive,discover the latest from emerging brands daily,software,https://www.youtube.com/embed/MfEcMxiZYBY?iv_load_policy=3&rel=0&modestbranding=1&playsinline=1&autoplay=1,Hello Im Renaud s4,,there I'm Reno and I'm building archive archive is a product hunt but for fashion bringing you the latest from emerging Brands daily I wanted to change how people discover fashion because I find that most people are being styled by the algorithms on platforms like Instagram and Tick Tock Brands can post their latest collections or pieces or even create countdowns for upcoming drops that are coming soon right now the last thing to implement is just a timer for upcoming drops and the ability for users to actually get notified when those drops happen as I've been building I've been also posting rigorously on platforms like Instagram and Tick Tock trying to build a community because essentially that's what archive is with little success but those few followers and connections that we did make were incredibly valuable we connected with some small Brands and even some big brands that just caught us on their radar and are super excited for the project and have joined the latest the next step is to coordinate the launch with various Brands so that they could have all their products at launch on archives so when users go on to Archive they already see a plethora of fashion items to look through and if you want to follow the journey you can follow me on Instagram Evernote PC r-e-n-a-u-d-p-c or on Twitter at Reno PC

The app allows community members to come to a consensus on prayer time changes through voting. I wanted to emphasize the importance of attending the mosque, so the app provides time-sensitive notifications to prepare for prayer. Our next steps include allowing users to create profiles and customize preferences. Download the beta version using the QR code on the screen and never miss a prayer again!",hi uh my name is OAS and I'm building sabil it's an app that Bridges the gap between Muslims and mosques it's a place you can track the prayer times for your local mosque as well as what's going on in the community so the way it works is that the members of the community can come to a consensus when there's a change in the prayer times one person would make a request like so then the next few people who try to change the same prayer time would be given the ability to vote on the change that has been requested and this way everyone plays an active role so the reason that I created this app was because I found that many apps would show the at that time and give you notifications based on that but I wanted to create an app where it emphasized attending the mosque recently we added the functionality of time sensitive notifications where it tells you what time you should prepare to leave your house and our next steps would be to allow users to create a profile and edit their preferences if you're interested go ahead and use the QR code on the screen to download the beta and then make an effort to not miss the prayer in the mosque

Nights & Weekends s4,,hi I'm Nick I'm an educator and a product manager and I'm making it easier for people to break into product management using AI one of the reasons why it's difficult to break into product management is it is that you need experience in the job however if you don't if you're trying to just start your product career it can be obviously really hard to get that experience so that's why we're building Prospero it's an AI tool that helps you gain a real world experience solving product problems and then you can actually show your work to potential employers the way it works is you can select a project or a select a skill you want to learn and then we generate a real world scenario and then our AI actually walks you through the steps that you need to take to solve that problem once you're done you can then upload your work and onto a portfolio that you can then share with employers so over the last six weeks we spent most of our time gaining feedback from people and really scoping and narrowing out the product Direction we've gotten around 10 beta users to go to use our platform and we've learned a lot from them and our next goal for the next few weeks is to go out uh into the market we're looking to put on some events to attract potential product managers uh to use our platform and also we're going to be updating our demo with a bunch of new features uh yeah so that's my demo thank you and see you in San Francisco

make sure the check out the fitbuddy website ➡️ fitbuddy.framer.ai
you can dm me on twitter too! ➡️ thelostpenguin7",hey there I'm Shreya and I build shipbuddy a community of people who help each other find well-fitted clothing I built this because I've always been shy and self-conscious about how I look in clothes and I felt like I can pull off a lot of these amazing outfits that I saw other people wearing on social media because I just didn't look like them so I wanted to create a supportive space for people to celebrate all the different shapes and sizes that we come in so here's how it works we head to this site and add the app to our home screen automatically it's installed on your phone I'll open it up upload a picture write a quick caption of what I'm wearing pick my measurements pick out the sizes I'm wearing and post it'll pop up on my feed and once I'm on my feed I can browse what everybody else is wearing and I can even filter if I want to see people who are closer to my measurements so my journey started six weeks ago I posted my idea on Twitter thinking that nothing would come of it but then I got some comments and interest so I created a Discord community and posted demo videos but not many people joined so I messaged everyone that I could think of and some gave valuable feedback and then some completely forgot um so I thought okay let's make it easier what if we built out an app so I created a landing page for the app and I got 49 unique visitors and over a hundred views so then I got to designing and building so even though I didn't get many users with the feedback that I did get there's definitely potential so if you're interested send me a DM and check out the website for more details bye

Check it out at poetic.ink",hi my name is nickel and I'm making poetic a lyric writing app that kills writer's block here's how it works to start off whenever you select any word in your lyrics you can generate things like synonyms rhymes or related words related words are basically other words that you might see in the same sentence as the word before but more importantly what you can do when you get into writer's block is generate new lyric ideas with this button go generate anywhere from five to ten you can scroll through them if you like one you can add it to the lyrics by clicking on it and you can also customize the type of suggestions you get and the references those lyrics make by adding these things called Tags so in my case I put Hollywood in movies and you can add any Niche topics you want so the AI will make references to that topic in terms of traction we've seen a little over 100 installations in the past month but we're hoping to get a little bit more traction and some more feedback because that's been a weak point of ours in the next few weeks the way I'm going to be doing that is through getting press at my local University and also being more active on social media finally if any of that sounds interesting to you and you want to try it out you can head over to poetic.inc spelled with an ink and download it right now in the App Store thanks

metrics - techstackjobs.com/metrics",hi everyone my name is CD and I'm making a job board so my idea is a job board that lets you see all the technologies that a company uses so for example if you look at plate HT then you know that they're looking for a senior machine machine learning engineer and they use all these different Technologies and lets you filter for jobs based on these Technologies for example AWS certificate manager jobs if you took the certificate course then you have a higher chance of applying and qualifying for these jobs therefore increasing your conversion and thus increasing the speed of your job search so right now I've had about a thousand page views in the past six weeks since starting build Space page views is fine but what I'm really focusing on is the metrics number of applies which haven't been great in the past two weeks I've only had let's see three applies so far so the conversion rate of that is significantly lower where I'm going now is one I think there's some very basic product decisions to make here is you want our own unique job posting and of course a company pages so job pages and Company Pages as well as making a bit more um features based on feedback from users that I've had so far yeah so check out my project techstackjobs.com uh and would love to get your feedback on Twitter cats are cuter98

""Whats up buildspace, my name is tanner. I’m a software developer with a hardware background, with over 30 years of gaming experience. I’m building an open world metaverse puzzle RPG that contains unique play-to-earn and staking opportunities only possible on Solana. I learned how to take on 3D development using Blender, and have begun establishing lore, and a world to bring it to life in. I’ve become an active member in the Portals community and have accelerated their development through feedback integral to our game, and with their help have established new features and functionality to enhance player experience. The gaming ecosystem will be managed by a DAO, who’s treasury will be used to fund project development. Over the last 6 weeks, i built out minigames, created servers on firestore for player data, made connections with awesome backend developers to work with, created a github repository and began drafting our whitepaper for our tokenomics and governance, and created a website to raise awareness. We’ve got a long road ahead of us, but plenty of exciting things to work on. Reach out if you want to learn more or be a part. Do you like lore? What’s next for the Resonance ecosystem is posting bounties to our devs to write the programs that we will be providing open-source to advance indie game development for all in the web3 space, and continuing to leverage DeFi on Solana to create real-world earning opportunities for gamers.""",what's up builds face I'm Tanner I am a software developer with a hardware background and over 30 Years of Gaming experience I'm building an open world metaverse puzzle RPG that contains unique play to earn and staking opportunities only possible I learned how to take on 3D development using blender and have begun establishing lore in a world to bring it to life in I've become an active member in the portals community and have accelerated their development through feedback integral to our game with their help have established new features and functionality to enhance player experience the gaming ecosystem will be managed by a Dao whose treasury will be used to fund project development over the last six weeks I built out many games created servers on firestore for player data made connections with awesome back-end developers to work with created a GitHub repository and began drafting our white paper for our tokenomics and governance and created a website to raise awareness we've got a long road ahead of us with plenty of exciting things to work on reach out if you want to learn more be a part what's next for the resonance ecosystem is posting boundaries to our devs to write the programs that we will be providing open source to advance indie game development for all the web 3 space and continuing to leverage defy on Solana to create real world earning opportunities for

twitter: https://twitter.com/vmscode",what's up your space I go by VMS code on YouTube and I'm building softwares which is a website that is going to display graph visualizations in order to make it easier for you to understand what is going on on a complex software project I started off by creating a code Editor to allow people to put their own code and visualize but then I decided to Pivot at least for now because I thought it was better to just focus on improving the graph visualization first so I went through several different iterations of graphs and this is where I'm at now this is a graph that represents the abstract syntax tree of a python file from the pandas project which is this file here so this code eventually gets compiled down into assembly and then machine code and the abstract syntax tree is one of the parts of this process so here the different colors of the node represent different types of nodes the blue node represents the file which contains the file path here and the other nodes contain other information about the file which is just that abstract syntax tree so the Orange is variables for example and then you have several different variations so one thing that you can do here for now is just click on the link and it takes you to this draw music here but eventually I'm going to add a lot of functionality to the link for example adding the ability to navigate throughout the project and the whole idea is just pretty much that is your display code in graph visualizations in three dimensions and here you can see that you can customize you can move the graph around you have different options here and by doing that and using the colors and the graph visualizations it's going to make a lot easier to understand the complex software project because then you won't have to go file by file and trying to see how everything connects together it's just much better and more efficient to look at the graph and to use the colors should get additional information of the code in a very easy way so this is what I have so far and I have a lot of other stuff coming soon if you want to continue to see me building the stuff you can follow me at YouTube is VMS code or follow me at Twitter and I'm building this stuff for the most part while live streaming so yeah just check it out and peace

Nutrisnap. As a diabetic who has been through   various diets I understand firsthand how hard 
it can be to keep track of what we eat on a   daily basis. That's why I created Nutrisnap, a 
tool designed to help you understand what you   eat and keep track of it in an easy way. Just take a picture. Using Nutrisnap is as easy as one two three. Simply snap a picture of your 
meal, let our artificial intelligence analyze it   then you can review the details if necessary 
and then you're done. Save it to your log meal.   The journey to this point has been incredible we 
started six weeks ago with nothing but an idea and   thinking it would be nearly impossible to create 
an artificial intelligence that would be smart   enough to detect the multiple elements in a plate.
We started with zero PPL (people) now we are more than 25   and growing so it was very nice at every step of the way. We've transformed the idea into something that works and I hope will help people. But we are not stopping here. Looking forward we plan to introduce new features including Community Driven suggestions,
an integration with popular health app and sports app so you can track your 
calorie intake and outtake So if you want to join and you always needed someone to accompany you through your diet Nutrisnap is made for you"

aya wallet,a platform to help distinguish humans from ai online,software,https://www.youtube.com/embed/V9ki8LdfWoQ?iv_load_policy=3&rel=0&modestbranding=1&playsinline=1&autoplay=1,aya wallet - final demo - nights&weekends s04,90s video going over the progress I've made during nights and weekends season 4,hey guys it's Joe and I'm building a platform called iwallet that helps distinguish humans from AI online let me show you how it works now there are two user groups Proverbs who want a Wii to be trusted online and verifiers who want to assess the quality of this proof approver signs up for a count and uploads verifiable proofs of their personal Hood and then they share a link to this detail online whereas a verifier on the other hand follows that link and verifies that it proof sufficiently meets their concerns so this journey started off as a as a question what is the nature of a democracy if you cannot tell what is real from what is not so to get started I jumped into some simple wireframes I did the all essential story mapping and then I wrapped up with some high fidelity mock-ups and since I happen to be a coding ninja I outsourced some of the development work and by some I really mean all and it's been going pretty good so far so what's next well I want to create a record of a user's score because I believe that consistency over time builds trust and I want to create content validation because now that we know that a user is who they say they are what about the content that they create is it a deep fake so I think that's the next logical step

It summarises the traction and value proposition behind Casa.

There were a lot of other hurdles along the way... like burning a hole in my smartphone camera image sensor and having to repair it myself to shoot the demo...

or deploying production bugs at 1am and getting saved by early-supporters who told me they can't login...

or rearchitecting the deployments to host the platform on a subdomain...

but here's to more building and more growth! 🌱",hi my name is Rowan I'm working on finding the properties that you want to buy and rent in under five minutes Casa is a property platform that uses your profile and cool AI features to provide you with relevant matches then you can track the progress of your home hunt on the platform so let's say we want to start our journey we want to buy we want to look in a specific area suppose that's Canary Wharf we want to make sure that's a vibrant area so wood will for example and then we can give it an AI prompt which will be used by the platform to provide us with matches every day here's an example of what a match might look like we'd be able to swipe through the listings and we'd even get an AI Insight from Casa that gives us an unbiased opinion on the area and other crime statistics and other information that is available publicly this makes it easier to support dealflow and will be able to manage the status of our inquiry all the way through to collecting the keys and moving in started out finding the value prop in week one week two I showed the MVP preview and got a bunch more signups in calculus analytics it was great exposure week five we launched the Rebrand and traction grew even more hitting almost 100 sign ups and over 20 verified users and here I am now I quit my job I'm building I'm fundraising and I'm ready to launch again soon so join me on this journey and join the castle waitlist now foreign

check out my newsletter :)
https://makeshiftbattery.substack.com/",hi I'm Sasha and I'm building a battery from abundant materials so essentially the problem that we have with our batteries right now is that they're not sustainable and they're too expensive so they're not sustainable because a lot of the materials that we use are really toxic for the environment so both Mining and disposing of these materials causes a bunch of terrible environmental effects and they're too expensive because a lot of the materials that we use are also really expensive for example lithium is quite expensive and when we try to scale these up for things like grid scale storage which are really important to helping to stop climate change it just becomes completely unfeasible so I think that by using abundant materials we can help to solve both of these problems and that's what I've been working on so I have written an article that covers all the materials in Lithium-ion batteries and also their purposes and I'm currently working on building a video that explains how a lithium ion battery works next I want to dive super deep into the problem why are Lithium-ion batteries made the way they are how cheap do they have to be to be sustainable what are existing Solutions and why don't they work by the end of this it would be an absolute dream come true if I can make a proposal for a battery that is both sustainable and cost effective if you want to stay updated with this project feel free to subscribe to my newsletter where I'll be posting updates I'll link that down below and with that thank you so so much for watching I hope you learned something and have an amazing rest of your day [Music] thank you

- an AI copilot to improve all knowledge work. Here’s an Obsidian plugin I’m building. You write 
a question like this and ask Atlanticus. Now   we need to wait. This is what I shipped for now 
but I’m thinking of a simpler user flow for this. There we have the answer. It has even 
linked to the relevant page for us.   We could also generate auto generate backlinks. 6 weeks ago I wanted to accelerate scientific 
research by building AI capable of mathematical   reasoning. I began researching LLMs. Obviously, 
I couldn’t do this justice in 6 weeks. But from   the studying effort I put in, I realized 
that documenting what you’ve learned is   incredibly broken. So I wondered if LLMs could 
fix this. I thought of automated backlink   generation so I shipped a sketch of the flow. 
Then I built and shipped it with a waitlist. Numbers aren’t something I was concerned 
with rn - I wanted a small cohort I could   talk to and iterate with. 9 people 
signed up, and I spoke to a few and   got a ton of insights into how knowledge 
retrieval in apps like Roam, Obsidian,   and Notion was broken. I'm now building 
an Obsidian plugin instead to prioritize   shipping and finding new people to talk to to 
maximize early learning. I’m currently assembling   a new cohort of people who use Obsidian 
from random Discord and Reddit communities I was super happy with the problem 
validation I received and realized   that I’m onto something here so I’m 
definitely going to keep shipping   this and see where it goes. If this sounds 
interesting to you, you should hit me up.   I’m passionate about accelerating scientific 
research and see this as a means to do that!"

I believe that when organisations will successfully adopt full knowledge graphs of their internal data into AI chatbots, they will quickly realise, that they can enable some of those bots to actually talk across the organisations.

Users might get their own AI assistant checking in with the business AI assistant. Business organisations might be using their AI bots to talk to other businesses AI bots.

And I want to build a platform that allows all of that to happen.",hi I'm arnoldus and I'm making a service that lets you get answers from your supplier instantly let me show you how it works so first you uh send a link to a supplier to a type of question that you would be asking regularly the supplier then selects the system that they actually use to find that answer normally in this case it's a HubSpot and you know they authenticate they make sure we have access and that's it all you have to do is just click a button send an API call and get an answer also their answer might not be matching your systems so you might get to standardize it with AI as well so and the reason I'm making this is because I believe businesses will have AIS that understand everything about them and when you have multiple businesses like this you know they're going to want to exchange information from time to time and then you need the highway to do it so I made a funny toy and then I miss prototypes and wireframes but yeah no one really cared or understood what I'm doing here so I just went out and talked to a lot of a lot of different people and the truth is everyone's spending a lot of human hours a lot of paid human hours to actually move information around it's not inventing new information it's just moving it around so if communication is costing your business a lot of money now let me know I wanna I wanna automate it so I'm going to keep on working on this

Podcast:
@QUEZTxyz",what's up build space my name is Christian AKA Quest and for the last six weeks I've been conducting research on how to make Esports a more sustainable business let's take a look so on my website I've been Gathering a bunch of data and a bunch of sources and effectively listing out what the problem what some of the good things are and also some of my own proposals are for the space in a nutshell the biggest problem that's currently happening amongst many others is what I call the neighbor's pie problem which is where game Publishers are their individuals seeing most of the upside which makes sense because they are the ones that made the game while a lot of the participants in the Esports industry are just trying to get their own slice my theory is that in order for the Esports industry to properly survive they need to make their own pie so to speak now I have not necessarily garnered a bunch of interest from consumers but I have been able to get interest from participants of the industry broadcasters lawyers content creators coaches Esports org owners and many others and this has been huge for me because I've been inviting them all into my podcast and getting their unique perspectives on how we could push the industry forward together what I would like to do next is for me to continue conducting interviews getting more research and then effectively solidifying myself as a trusted advisor of the space such that I might eventually become a consultant or strategist or participants that's all I got for you guys appreciate it and I'll catch you on the flip side peace

hearthside hangouts,an app that helps you join and run online book club events easily.,software,https://www.youtube.com/embed/4VHDMdEuCKY?iv_load_policy=3&rel=0&modestbranding=1&playsinline=1&autoplay=1,Hearthside Hangouts - an app to join & run online bookclub events easily / nights & weekends S4 demo,"hey - I'm Naomi, and this is my demo for nights & weekends S4.

I'm building Hearthside Hangouts. It's an app that helps you join and run book club events online thanks to goal-based reading and voice chat. Check it out - https://joinbook.club !

With Hearthside Hangouts, you can create and join book clubs, pick a book, set reading goals for your club, create voice/text discussion rooms and RSVP to club events - all from a single app.

It's like Clubhouse or Discord, but it helps bring book lovers together very easily, from your mom's bookclub to booktube/booktok/bookstagram - including authors !

I built a MVP during HackFS 2023 in less than 2 weeks and decided to rebuild everything from scratch for nights and weekends. I was able to launch in after around 30 days of development.

Once I made the app public, I reached out to everyone that showed interest on my slide idea on Twitter (~30 people) ; I also posted under booktuber videos (and got reported as spam),  instagram (and got reported as spam), book subreddits (and got reported as spam), tech subreddits, tech discord servers and LinkedIn.

When I recorded this video, I had 17 members, and 3 of them created their book club.
I'm happy with my progress and to see that some people are interested by my app. I hope to get more people onboarded soon, but for that I need to improve my app first by squashing a few bugs and implementing new features, like moderation and private clubs.

nights & weekends s4 really had me speedrun the development phase and reach out to potential users. It was hard ngl, but I really enjoyed it. I'm quite surprised with how much I was able to ship in just 30 days - even more surprised I got a few people to test my app and create their clubs !

I definitely recommend nights & weekends to you if you have a tendency to overthink and/or you keep on adding features to your app before launching (and never end up launching). Getting your stuff out there is scary, but honestly ? once you ship, even if you get negative feedback, you can already be proud of what you were able to accomplish so far.

Get tf out of localhost my dudes !

---

Hearthside Hangouts was initially built during HackFS 2023 hackathon as a web3 mobile app with the following stack: Expo (React Native), Tamagui, Huddle01 and Polybase.

Duright n&w, I decided to start everything from scratch and with a completely different stack. Hearthside Hangouts is now a PWA (progressive web app) built with Astro (initially v2 but I migrated to v3), SolidJS, Pocketbase, Livepeer and Livekit. I deployed it with Vercel initially but switched to SST.

You can try it here : https://joinbook.club

It's buggy but hey - it's live and I'm already proud of myself for that :)

see in voice chat !

I've been contributing to several Instagram pages on Real Madrid, and my goal was to improve my consistency, quality, and the diversity of topics I cover.

From writing match reports and player transfer analyses, I've expanded into discussing topics like advertising, brands in sports, and stories of leadership since joining Buildspace.

I've not only established a solid lineup of upcoming topics but also ventured into new storytelling formats. Along the way, I've discovered what truly matters to me—producing content—while my teammates handle audience engagement, scheduling, and management.

Initially, I had grand plans of building a new audience and launching my own website or even seeking sponsorships. However, I realized that my passion lies in content creation and that it's okay to focus on what I do best.

Stay tuned as I'll soon be sharing some of the curated topics on the pages I collaborate with. One example is a thought-provoking piece on how leadership transformed Real Madrid in the early 2000s, which received a lot of positive feedback.

Check it out and be sure to follow our pages.

#buildspace",hey Bill's face I'm Kyle I'm building a vehicle combat Battle Royale called crashland let's check it out app is based on Fort Mason in San Francisco where the build space offices um I chose this location to give people that go to the build space nights and weekends IRL event a place to play um and actually be physically present as well as for people that couldn't make it to go play in the area so they can come in fight each other and we'll see who wins so I started this journey and talking about my concept on Twitter and other social media as well as real life events then I launched the game on itch.io pretty early on to see where it would go shared a lot of concept art with people and got some great feedback all along the way I did player testing with some hilarious results like these flips from posting on socials I was able to draw more attention to the game and grow its Twitter following to around 40 people as well as others across other platforms like LinkedIn the itch.io launch had over 20 downloads and this was really useful in helping me prototype the game with other people this prototype for crash time was really helpful in determining if people liked the concept of the game as well as testing some technology involved to build it from here I'll be looking to expand the team go into concept art World building and Community Building before we go to full scale production see you soon

CoralX 
Would like to thank build space for this wonderful opportunity to participate in this program. We appreciate all the work you all put in!",my name is Rob my name is along with our teammate Serrano we are coral X so we all knew that we wanted to help rebel Die in coral reefs because it's something that we're very passionate about so our thing became using AI to help rebuild coral reefs so we began by researching three things that we could potentially impact using choral sounds to map out the how disease will outbreak using pictures of it as well as satellite imagery but figure out that they're not viable because there's not enough data to do this so using a decision Matrix and merging ideas we came to the final idea of an AI model that analyzes different factors that result in choral outbreak to detect earlier on using number data so three factors we identified are turbidity temperature and bleaching levels because we found that they have the biggest impact on Coral outbreak and so here's some pictures of the models we've built We Begin linear regression figure that was not effective because it doesn't match the complexity of the problem we're solving and after doing svms 2 we ended on neural networks because they can match that complexity and add on more layers too which is amazing and here's our demo the neural network model we we've kind of been making these past six weeks and so it doesn't have a correct output yet just some data that we add to in Excel but we're working on that so certain demo in order to track trust we create an Instagram and we posted one of our older weekly updates and gained some followers as well as we contacted different choral organizations and got promising emails from other people showing interest in our product we also developed a position paper in order to summarize our topic and what we are building and hopefully to reach out to Academia in the future our future goals consist of finishing out the model and as I mentioned before releasing it to Academia

greenscape,a tool that suggests plants that love your home,ai/ml,https://www.youtube.com/embed/ms2FF8dty94?iv_load_policy=3&rel=0&modestbranding=1&playsinline=1&autoplay=1,Greenscape: 90-Second Journey Recap,"Hey there, folks! This video is all about summing up our adventure while creating Greenscape in N&W S4 over the past 6 weeks.","Hello everyone, Atreay Kukanur here. Me, along 
with my friend Devaraj, have been working on   an exciting project called Greenscape. Its 
a tool that suggets plants for your home. We got the idea for this when we 
noticed something interesting. You know,   many folks who adore plants and want them in 
their homes sometimes unintentionally harm   their green buddies. Why? Well, it's 
often because they're not sure about   the right steps to care for them or which 
plants are best for their particular area. To counter this problem we developed greenscape. Now, let me walk you through how it 
works. Once you log in to Greenscape,   you'll find a sleek landing page with three 
options: region, plant type, and climate.   These options contain various choices, allowing 
you to select the parameters that matter most to   you. With these selections, Greenscape will 
recommend the perfect plants for your home,   taking into account all the factors 
required for their healthy growth. In N&W S4, we started with a simple idea 
and developed a basic version of our tool.   Users could input a plant name 
and get recommendations. However,   after releasing this ""toy"" version for people 
to try, we received valuable feedback. Many   users found it challenging to figure out which 
plant to input, given the vast number of options. To address this, we iterated on our 
tool and introduced dropdown menus,   making it easier for users to select 
their search criteria. Initially,   we had only 25 sign-ups, which wasn't 
very satisfying. To boost our user base,   we took a proactive approach. We reached out 
to people on Twitter, WhatsApp, and implemented   a new feature. Now, users can simply type in 
the name of the plant, and Greenscape provides   a step-by-step guide on how to care for and 
grow that specific plant, thanks to GPT-3.5. With these enhancements, we managed to attract 
around 200 users and achieved 2.4k event counts. We're grateful to all the users who tried our 
product, and we have exciting news! In the   coming week, we're gearing up to launch 
Greenscape on Product Hunt. Stay tuned!"

Passphrases just make sense.

Made with love by me @_buildspace 

Give it a try 👇
genphrase.com

Socials in bio.",what's up guys my name is Dylan Tsai maker of genfreys.com it's at websites where users can generate memorable secure passphrases so what are pass phrases passphrases are a kind of password that are characterized by random words instead of random characters and on gen phrase users can also generate passwords based on the characteristics that they want for example if I wanted to make a password with four words and separated by spaces I'd select my desired length and inside include separator I enter a space and I'd hit generate passphrase the journey was honestly pretty wild I had two ideas such as in pan outs and one day it hit me I hate boring passwords let's make passwords sexier and still secure so what's next great question I still plan to add in a few more features that still let passwords be memorable and make this project my contribution to the internet for all of the free stuff I've ever used and uh get some street cred if you know what I mean so come give it a try genfreys.com see you next time
